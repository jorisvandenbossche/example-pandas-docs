Patterns
========

foo.__class__
-------------

*pandas* uses 'type(foo)' instead 'foo.__class__' as it is making the code more
readable.

For example:

**Good:**

.. code-block:: python

    foo = "bar"
    type(foo)

**Bad:**

.. code-block:: python

    foo = "bar"
    foo.__class__


String formatting
=================

Concatenated strings
--------------------

f-strings
~~~~~~~~~

*pandas* uses f-strings formatting instead of '%' and '.format()' string formatters.

The convention of using f-strings on a string that is concatenated over serveral lines,
is to prefix only the lines containing the value needs to be interpeted.

For example:

**Good:**

.. code-block:: python

    foo = "old_function"
    bar = "new_function"

    my_warning_message = (
        f"Warning, {foo} is deprecated, "
        "please use the new and way better "
        f"{bar}"
    )

**Bad:**

.. code-block:: python

    foo = "old_function"
    bar = "new_function"

    my_warning_message = (
        f"Warning, {foo} is deprecated, "
        f"please use the new and way better "
        f"{bar}"
    )

White spaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Putting the white space only at the end of the previous line, so
there is no whitespace at the beggining of the concatenated string.

For example:

**Good:**

.. code-block:: python

    example_string = (
        "Some long concatenated string, "
        "with good placement of the "
        "whitespaces"
    )

**Bad:**

.. code-block:: python

    example_string = (
        "Some long concatenated string,"
        " with bad placement of the"
        " whitespaces"
    )

Representation function (aka 'repr()')
--------------------------------------

*pandas* uses 'repr()' instead of '%r' and '!r'.

The use of 'repr()' will only happend when the value is not an obvious string.

For example:

**Good:**

.. code-block:: python

    value = str
    f"Unknown recived value, got: {repr(value)}"

**Good:**

.. code-block:: python

    value = str
    f"Unknown recived type, got: '{type(value).__name__}'"


Imports (aim for absolute)
==========================

In Python 3, absolute imports are recommended. In absolute import doing something
like ``import string`` will import the string module rather than ``string.py``
in the same directory. As much as possible, you should try to write out
absolute imports that show the whole import chain from toplevel pandas.

Explicit relative imports are also supported in Python 3. But it is not
recommended to use it. Implicit relative imports should never be used
and is removed in Python 3.

For example:

::

    # preferred
    import pandas.core.common as com

    # not preferred
    from .common import test_base

    # wrong
    from common import test_base
